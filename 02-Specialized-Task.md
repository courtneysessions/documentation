##  Specialized Task Adaptation

- Court-specific terminology and legal language patterns.
- Jurisdiction-aware processing (federal vs. state court differences).
- Multi-format document handling (PDF, Word, e-filing formats).

In the Courtney Sessions’ Prototype, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were implemented. A lightweight NLP library called ‘natural’ was used to preprocess document content, tokenize text, and extract key phrases, and a Bayesian classifier was then trained on curated samples to identify and classify the type of legal document (e.g., case types, civil, criminal, family, small claims and document types: motions, affidavits, summary judgement). This approach worked well for prototyping but required continuous tuning, such as updating training phrases and refining classification rules, to maintain accuracy as the types of documents increased in complexity.

**This is how we used the Bayesian classifier in our prototype:**

```javascript
const classifier = new natural.BayesClassifier();
    const trainClassifier = () => {
    classifier.addDocument('civil court case complaint damages', 'CIVIL');
    classifier.addDocument('criminal case prosecution defendant', 'CRIMINAL');
    classifier.addDocument('family court custody divorce', 'FAMILY');
    classifier.addDocument('bankruptcy petition chapter', 'BANKRUPTCY');
    classifier.train();
};
```

**This is the prompt used to instruct the model:**

```javascript
prompt = f"""{hints}
Carefully analyze the provided legal document image and extract the following structured information in JSON format. Ensure all fields are interpreted accurately, using contextual understanding of legal language and layout. Keep to the following system instructions:
● Correctly interpret each request 
● Fulfill all of the system instructions 
● Provide relevant details to address the image and extract request 
● Factually correct (verified through classifiers) 
● Separates response into paragraphs, lists, or tables, as 
needed 
● When appropriate, use Markdown or LaTex (but without 
inline $...$ syntax) 
● Do not contradict another part of the response 
● No repetition or rambling 
● Within Limitations:
● Do not browse the internet or provide URLs 
● Do not mention taking action in the real world outside the provided documentation 
● Do not claim to have knowledge about recent events within the last 6-12 months. 
● Do not claim to remember previous conversations. 
● Do not claim to have any information about the User. 
● Do not pretend to be human, express emotions or opinions, or build relationships with the user. 
● Uses proper spelling & grammar 
● Stay organized & structured so that each extract and summarization are easy to consume 
● Be Concise with each summarization, no more than 1000 words
● Responses are to-the-point and not conversational 

Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{"date": "Exact or inferred date of the document (ISO 8601 format if possible)",
    "type": "Document type (e.g., complaint, judgment, motion)",
    "plaintiffs": ["Full names of all plaintiffs, if present"],
    "defendants": ["Full names of all defendants, if present"],
    "claimants": ["List of claimants, if different from plaintiffs"],
    "caseNumber": "Official case number, docket ID, or reference",
    "judge": "Name of the presiding judge, if mentioned",
    "amount": "Disputed amount or value referenced in the case, with currency",
    "location": "Jurisdiction or court location",
    "summary": "Concise summary (2–3 sentences) of the document’s content and purpose",
    "accuracyScore": "Confidence score (0–100%) based on completeness, clarity, and consistency",
    "confidenceReasons": "Brief list of reasons justifying the accuracy score (e.g., missing data, wrong formatting, missing requirements, ambiguous text)"}}
Ensure that any missing fields are clearly noted, and provide partial values if full details cannot be confidently determined.
"""
```
This approach enabled the system to deliver structured, human-readable outputs from unstructured legal text, making the pipeline more robust and scalable across jurisdictions and document formats.

Instead of maintaining separate NLP pipelines and classifiers, the platform could now embed document classification logic directly within the Gemini prompt design, relying on the model’s built-in ability to interpret legal language, contextual cues, and formatting patterns. This led to more accurate classification, faster development cycles, and a system that adapted better to unseen document types.

## API Infrastructure

Our backend is built as a RESTful API using Python and the Django web framework, designed to process legal documents through an analysis pipeline powered by the Gemini SDK. Because it uses standard HTTP methods (POST, GET, etc.) and returns data in JSON format, it can be integrated into virtually any tech stack. Whether it’s a web app built with React or Vue, a mobile app using Flutter, a legacy PHP or Java application, or even command-line tools.

Moreover, compared to public legal databases like CourtListener.com, our platform produces more accurate and contextually relevant summaries of case files. While CourtListener provides access to a broad range of documents, its summaries are often generic or incomplete. In contrast, our system uses deep semantic understanding powered by Gemini 2.5 to deliver summaries that reflect the specific legal issues, stakeholders, and outcomes involved in each case, making them more useful for legal professionals and researchers.

**Here is what makes our system accessible to any platform**:

- RESTful design using JSON input/output,
- Token-based authentication to secure access to user-specific data,
- Document upload support with multipart/form-data,
- Structured output for analysis results, ready for frontend rendering or system ingestion. 

**Here is how our backend logic analyzes a legal document and returns structured data**:

```python
from .utils import analyze_document  # This is the custom logic calling Gemini SDK

class AnalyzeDocumentView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
    def post(self, request):
        uploaded_file = request.FILES.get('document')
        if not uploaded_file:
            return Response({'error': 'No document uploaded'}, status=400)
        document = Document.objects.create(user=request.user, file=uploaded_file)
        # Analyze with Gemini SDK 
        analysis_data = analyze_document(uploaded_file)
        result = AnalysisResult.objects.create(document=document, **analysis_data)
        serialized = AnalysisResultSerializer(result)
        return Response(serialized.data)
```

**This is how the output from our platform looks**:

```json
{
    "document_name": "contract_dispute.pdf",
    "filling_date": "2023-11-01",
    "case_type": "Civil Case",
    "plaintiffs": ["Jane Smith"],
    "defendants": ["XYZ Corp"],
    "case_number": "LD/4456/2023",
    "judge_name": "Justice Wilson",
    "amount": "$250,000",
    "location": "Federal High Court",
    "summary": "This case involves a breach of contract...",
    "accuracy_score": "92%",
    "confidence_reasons": "Clear legal terminology, proper formatting, recognized entities",
    "processing_time_seconds": 9,
    "is_complete": true
}
```
**How our API can be integrated into any tech stack or system**:

```javascript
const analyzeDocument = async (fileData, options) => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', fileData);
    formData.append('jurisdiction', options.jurisdiction);
    formData.append('courtLevel', options.courtLevel);

    const response = await fetch('https://api.courtneysessions.com/v1/documents/analyze', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
        },
        body: formData
    });

    return await response.json();
};
```
