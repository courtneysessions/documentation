## Agentic Workflow Architecture
**Gemini-Powered Agent Capabilities**

Document Processing Agent:
- Gemini Vision for scanned document OCR and layout analysis
- Gemini Pro for complex multi-page document understanding
- Custom fine-tuned models for judicial-specific entity extraction
- Document fine grained classification i.e by case type and sub-type

Compliance Validation Agent:
- Rule-based validation using jurisdiction-specific knowledge graphs
- Gemini Pro for natural language compliance checking
- Confidence scoring based on RAG retrieval, and human-in-the-loop validation.

Scheduling Agent:
- Automated party notification and status updates
- Natural language generation for court correspondence
- Multi-modal communication (email, SMS, portal notifications)

**Court-Optimized Model Variants**

**Gemma-Judicial Local Series**:
- Gemma-2B-Judicial: Ultra-lightweight for basic document classification
- Gemma-7B-Judicial-Pro: Full-featured local processing with compliance validation
- Gemma-9B-Judicial-Enterprise: Maximum accuracy for high-stakes legal analysis


**Model Compression & Quantization**

```python
    local_optimization_pipeline = {
        'quantization': 'Quantization to 8-bit integer precision, with minimal impact on task performance.',
        'pruning': 'Structured pruning that preserves domain-relevant attention heads and neuron groups',
        'PEFT': 'Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA for efficient legal domain adaptation using low-rank parameter updates',
        'hardware_acceleration': 'Custom ASIC integration for inference',
        'memory_optimization': 'Gradient checkpointing for 16GB RAM deployment'
    }
