## Agentic Workflow Architecture
Gemini-Powered Agent Capabilities
Document Processing Agent:
Gemini Vision for scanned document OCR and layout analysis
Gemini Pro for complex multi-page document understanding
Custom fine-tuned models for judicial-specific entity extraction
Document fine grained classification i.e by case type and sub-type
Compliance Validation Agent:
Rule-based validation using jurisdiction-specific knowledge graphs
Gemini Pro for natural language compliance checking
Confidence scoring based on RAG retrieval, and human-in-the-loop validation.
Scheduling Agent:
Automated party notification and status updates

**Model Compression & Quantization**

```python
    local_optimization_pipeline = {
        'quantization': 'Quantization to 8-bit integer precision, with minimal impact on task performance.',
        'pruning': 'Structured pruning that preserves domain-relevant attention heads and neuron groups',
        'PEFT': 'Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA for efficient legal domain adaptation using low-rank parameter updates',
        'hardware_acceleration': 'Custom ASIC integration for inference',
        'memory_optimization': 'Gradient checkpointing for 16GB RAM deployment'
    }
